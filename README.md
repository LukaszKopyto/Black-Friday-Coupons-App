- Displaying coupon details on a popup, after clicking the coupon button (popup only for desktop and tablet view)
- Copying the coupon code to the clipboard

- Fetch data using axios:
  - Receive an access token to authorize next request
  - Retrieving coupon data from one endpoint based on an ID retrieved from another endpoint
  - Transform response (filtering and mapping large list of ID's) before Axios return response
